# SQL_Project
This is my SQL learning journey, I will update this repository with time.

In this basic journey we will be working with below SQL dataset about different job posting facts of Data industry.

At first you can open this data set by visiting this link below.  will be using browser for basic understanding using "sqliteviz" online on browser
https://lukeb.co/sql_jobs_db

https://sqliteviz.com/app/#/workspace?hide_schema=1

Later on we will connect pgAdmin postgreSQL with VsCode Editor and work with below dataset creating our own database
Downloading CSV dataset from link below and copying it to our database in the SQL table we create from scratch.
