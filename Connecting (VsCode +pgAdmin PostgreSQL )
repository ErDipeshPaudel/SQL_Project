Steps:
1. Open postgres SQL and enter your password
2. Open your folder in VsCode and create  test.sql file
3. Make sure to add extension (SQLTools and SQLTools PostgresSQL/Cockroach Driver)
4. > SQLTools icon in Vscode > Add new connection > postgreSQL
5. Fill connection name = database = username = "postgres"
6. > Test connection > Enter password (Successfully connected) > Save connection

Note: We do not use postgres database which ia already present there because it contains core database configuration
Now we create our new database onit

Folow folowing steps to create our database:
1. Click 'Postgres database' in VsCode
2. Write SQL command with your database name example. CREATE DATABASE  sql_dipesh
3. Click "Run on active connection" or use shortcut double press "Ctrl + E"
4. Goto pgAdmin and refresh postgres
5. Now you can see the database created in VsCode "sql_dipesh"  in pgAdmin database
6. Click on "sql_dipesh" your newly created database and it starts running 

Note: Now we create new connection with our databse we just created

Follow steps below for creating new connection
1. Click "Add new connection" on VsCode
2. Select postgreSQL
3. Fill connection name = database = "sql_dipesh" and  username = "postgres"
4. Test connection > Allow > Password > Save Connection 
5. Click on sql_dipesh database

Now our setup is done connecting
Click on "New SQL File"  this is where we write our SQL commands and perform CRUD operation
For example we write below commands to create our table:
CREATE TABLE job_applied (
    job_id INT,
    application_sent_date DATE,
    custom_resume BOOLEAN,
    resume_file_name VARCHAR(255),
    cover_letter_sent BOOLEAN,
    cover_letter_file_name VARCHAR(255),
    status VARCHAR(50)
);
After running this command you can check your new table in sql_dipesh > Schemas > public > Tables > "Here it shows your table columns"

Next: Head to file name "SQL Table Data Manupulation"
